# Lightning Paywall: Decentralized Paywalls for Content Creators

We aim to create a proof of concept for a decentralized paywall mechanism utilizing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and the Lightning Network. The idea here is to give content creators (blogs, artists, authors, creators) the ability to paywall certain content without giving a cut to Google, Meta, Apple, or Patreon. The project will involve linking a Lightning Network URL (LNURL) to a DID, thereby creating a seamless payment channel for accessing hosted content on a user's Decentralized Web Node (DWN).
